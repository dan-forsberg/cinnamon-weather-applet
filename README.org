This is a basic applet that uses data from SMHI's public API to show the current
weather, and forecasts.

This was made for Cinnamon, but probably works on GNOME too.

** Installation/usage
Clone and put in ~\~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/~ and enable

There are some variables which can be changed, such as the coordinates, and the
refresh rate, and how many forecasts to show. All that is available in the code.
